## Description

The project is focused on the detection and registration of vehicle license plates, along with the identification of the vehicle's make, color, and direction, while tracking entry and exit times. It also includes a voice-based notification system and a user-friendly interface, available in both a Windows application and a web application, operating offline without the need for an internet connection.

* **This Version**:

> In the current version, the system supports license plates from various categories, including police, IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps), military, Ministry of Defense, armed forces, public, agricultural, and private vehicles.

* **For Future**:
> In upcoming versions, priority will be given to enhancing the recognition of license plates for individuals with disabilities. Additionally, special plates such as those for diplomatic, ceremonial, and service vehicles will be supported, along with high-end and luxury vehicles classified under temporary permits.

* **Final Future**:
> The ultimate goal includes advanced features such as controlling access to authorized vehicles, automatically opening entry gates for verified plates, and monitoring temporary permit vehicles. The system will also manage traffic control in cities where certain restrictions apply, such as enforcing odd-even traffic rules, issuing fines for unauthorized driving or illegal parking, and more.

* **Potential Future Expansion**:
> A possible future feature could involve simulating the movement of a specific license plate over time, using previously recorded data to track and map its route history.

This advanced version emphasizes the system's potential for scalability and future technological integration.

### Innovations and Tools Used in This Project :

- OCR for Character Recognition in License Plates: Leveraging Optical Character Recognition to accurately detect and extract characters from vehicle license plates.
- CANVAS for Locating Specific Regions on the License Plate: Using advanced image manipulation tools to precisely locate and isolate specific areas of the license plate for further analysis.
- FLASK for Web-based License Plate Registration System: Developing a web-based system using Flask to handle real-time license plate recognition and registration.
- Recognition, Detection, and Localization in Neural Networks: Implementing various architectures in neural networks, including models designed for object detection, recognition, and localization tasks.
- YOLO-NAS, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv10 for License Plate Detection: Utilizing YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) for fast and efficient license plate detection within vehicle images, isolating the plates and passing them to the OCR network for character recognition.
- Attention Mechanism for Enhanced Vehicle Attribute Recognition: Using attention layers to improve the accuracy of recognizing key vehicle attributes such as make, color, and direction.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Serving as the primary architecture for the neural networks, particularly for feature extraction and classification tasks in image-based datasets.
- GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) for Synthetic License Plate Generation: Employing GANs to generate synthetic license plates, enabling the creation of large, unique datasets with millions of distinct plates for robust model training.
- Qt5, Qt6, PyQt5, PyQt6 for Windows-based License Plate Registration Systems: Utilizing Qt frameworks for building advanced GUI-based applications for license plate registration on Windows platforms.
